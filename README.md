# HighestCommonFactorKata
Code Kata to find Highest Common Factor for given Integer Array

1.For zero elements in array throw Exception with message,"Enter atleast two integers" as we have to find the highest common factor we require minimum two integers.

2.For single element in array throw Exception with message,"Enter atleast two integers" as we have to find the highest common factor we require minimum two integers.

3.For given Integer Array return the highest common factor.

4.For integer array with all values '0' throw Exception with message,"Highest common factor is undefined".

5.For negative integers highest common factor must be positive.

6.For mixed type of values(negative integers, zero,positive integers) highest common factor must be positive.
